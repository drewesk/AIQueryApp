# AIQueryApp

## LangChain Flask SerpAPI MongoDB Ollama Integration

- An Ollama AI model server
- SerpAPI for web search
- MongoDB for persistent chat memory

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drewesk/AIQueryApp.git
   cd langchain_flask_serpapi_mongo
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file with:

   ```
   SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```
_____

SerpAPI setup

1. Go to [serpapi.com](https://serpapi.com/), sign up.
2. Copy your API key.
3. Add to `.env`

MongoDB setup

1. Go to [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up.
2. Create a **free shared cluster**.
3. In **Database Access**, create a user with a username and password.
4. In **Network Access**, add IP `0.0.0.0/0` to allow all connections.
5. Click **Connect** â†’ **Connect your application**.
6. Choose:
   - **Driver**: Python
   - **Version**: Latest (e.g. 3.12 or later)
7. Copy the connection auto-genearated string, then add to your `.env` file

____

5. **Run Ollama model server:**

   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

6. **Pull model:**

   `ollama pull WhiteRabbitNeo/WhiteRabbitNeo-2.5-Qwen-2.5-Coder-7B`

   or use your <modelname> of choice and then modify `app.py` to reflect the new Model Name.

7. **Run the Flask app:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

8. **Send POST requests to the Flask app `/chat` endpoint with JSON body:**

    ```json
    {
      "prompt": "Your question here"
    }
    ```

    Example using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt":"What is the weather in NYC?"}'
    ```

> ðŸ’¡ To activate real-time web search (instead of using the local LLM), **prefix your prompt with the word `search`**.

This bypasses the local language model and uses your SerpAPI key to fetch live results directly from Google Search.

---

#### âœ… Example Using `search` Keyword:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"search the weather in NYC"}'
  ```

---

## Notes

- The app sends the prompt to the Ollama server API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`) to get AI responses.
- MongoDB stores the conversation history for persistent memory.
- SerpAPI is used internally for live search queries.
